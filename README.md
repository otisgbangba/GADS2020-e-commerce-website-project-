# GADS2020-e-commerce-website-project-
Develop a solution to promote e-commerce platforms and transition physical markets closer to the customers online.
I am presently working on the Backend and hope to finish it very soon.

Thank God I am able to run the ecommerce succesfully.
Initially, I wrote the frontend of the ecommerce webite with html, css and javascript which I posted for comment to the GADS2020 community and I really appreciate your response.
In order to ensure the functionality of the website, I had to work on the backed, which made me to consider using MYSQL Workbench to warehouse my table and data.
I did a table data using MYSQL Workbench and I had gto connect my database in MYSQL to my initial program in html through PHP MySQL commands:

mysqli_connect
mysqli_query
mysqli_fetch_array
mysqli_close
And through that I was able to link my databae to mhy website.
This I run and when I made payment by "Cash". The buyer will receive a mail in the email address submitted during the purchase to confirm pahyment as well as the delivery of the goods to the right destinatiom.
It such a beautiful eperience to start an ecommerce website from the scrath anfd finished it using html, css, js, MYSQL, PHP. 
Even though there may still be some other things that one may think of and wanted to add, please you are permitted to add in order to make this website one of the most responive  ecommece website.
Thanks GADS2020 for the opportunity given to me to deliever this project in time and use your platform to leverage on mhy skills in website development, even thouhgh I did Cloud related option.
